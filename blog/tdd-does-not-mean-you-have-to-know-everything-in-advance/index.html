<p>It sounds simple enough, but in practice you feel like this only works for rockstar developers. You have to have the perfect code in your head before you even start! But you don‚Äôt know how the code will look like. You just write it first and then add tests afterwards. Testing is a chore. You just do it because your PR will not be approved if you don‚Äôt or because someone will complain that code coverage went down.</p>
<p>If this is your experience, you‚Äôre not alone. Getting started is the hard part, that first failing test.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs see what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle">Wikipedia has to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adding of a new feature begins by writing a test that passes iff the feature‚Äôs specifications are met. The developer can discover these specifications by asking about use cases and user stories. A key benefit of test-driven development is that it makes the developer focus on requirements before writing code. This is in contrast with the usual practice, where unit tests are only written after code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often times the gap between the ‚Äúuse case‚Äù or ‚Äúuser story‚Äù you got assigned and the code is too big to just write a test. You don‚Äôt know enough about that part of the application or that part of the code to get started and you want to write some code to see what happens or to experiment with different solutions.</p>
<p>But you also want to do TDD and TDD says you need to write a failing test first üòÆ. So you get a chicken-and-egg problem. The thing is: that experimentation by writing code is part of ‚Äúdiscovering the specifications‚Äù, so it‚Äôs totally ok to hack away without tests at this stage.</p>
<p>Saying you can‚Äôt write any code without having a failing test first is like saying you can‚Äôt do <em>any</em> architecture or design because you‚Äôre doing TDD. There have also been misunderstandings about this. Uncle Bob <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html#emergence">has written about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that the high level design and architecture of a system emerge from TDD is, frankly, absurd. Before you begin to code any software project, you need to have some architectural vision in place. TDD will not, and can not, provide this vision. That is not TDD‚Äôs role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you know enough to write a failing test, make sure to <strong>start from scratch</strong>. If you don‚Äôt, testing will be harder and you will bypass a lot of the advantages of TDD. It will lead to complicated and brittle tests.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt need to delete all your code, but set it aside for inspiration and start from scratch <strong>with</strong> a failing test.</p>
<h1 id="tdd-is-an-ideal">TDD is an ideal</h1>
<p>We would like to live in magical fairy land where everything is perfect and we can Red -> Green -> Refactor all of our code all of the time. But we live in the real world. Of course there is code that is harder to test and code that is easier to test. Some parts of an application are inherently harder to test even if it‚Äôs the best code in the world. Some bad codebases make it very hard to write <em>any</em> tests. It‚Äôs easy to get discouraged trying to apply TDD there.</p>
<p>Should we write off TDD because of this? Does TDD suck because of this?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre having bad experiences try TDD on pure functions or a set of classes without dependencies first. Once you see the benefits, you‚Äôll be motivated to use it on the harder-to-test code as well.</p>
<p>TDD has gone through many misunderstandings over the years. I highly recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM">talk by Ian Cooper</a> for anyone practicing TDD.</p> </article> <hr data-astro-cid-4sn4zg3r>

<p>TDD is not so much about the code you end up with, but about <strong>the way you got there</strong>. The best way to learn TDD, is to <strong>pair with an experienced engineer</strong>.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt pair with every one of you, but there <strong>is</strong> something I can do:</p>
<p>Want to see how an <strong>experienced engineer</strong> uses <strong>TDD</strong> to build a <strong>web frontend</strong> and then <strong>apply it yourself</strong> in the same codebase?</p>
<p>Get the <strong>FREE</strong> TDD training exercise below.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll go further than the trivial examples you find all over the internet, but without the stress and hassle of a real project. That way you learn things you can <strong>actually use</strong> in your day job.</p>
<p>We will be implementing a registration flow where users can sign up and confirm their account with a verification code.</p>
<p>You get:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A <code>git</code> repository</strong> with:
        <ul>
            <li>the exercise itself</li>
            <li>the solution</li>
            <li>a commit for each step of the way</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>1.5 hour of video</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>going through the entire exercise from start to finish</li>
            <li>with explanation of what‚Äôs happening and why</li>
